(test 0 (p))

; In normal order evaluation the interpreter will first try to substitute test with the if statement:
; (if (= 0 0) 0 (p)). The predicate evaluates to true, so 0 is returned.
; In applicative order evaluation the interpreter will first try to expand the arguments 0 -> 0 and (p)->(p)->(p)->... and will enter an infinite loop.
